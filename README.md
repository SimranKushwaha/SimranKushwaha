### Hi there, I'm Simran ðŸ‘‹

 I am PhD candidate with a keen interest in understanding all aspects of the bacteria Salmonella. My research investigates a number of facets of this pathogen involving its epidemiology, antimicrobial resistance, defence system against viruses, molecular biology and host-pathogen interaction. I aim to identify new avenues for developing effective treatments against the ESKAPE pathogens using the CRISPR-Cas system. My expertise lies in computational biology, microbiology and molecular biology.

Ask me anything about Salmonella and CRISPR-Cas3.
